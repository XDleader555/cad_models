# Angled Dash Kit for ATOTO and Volkswagen MKIV
Upgrade that outdated head unit in your Volkswagen MKIV with a wireless CarPlay and Android Auto touchscreen head unit.

This 3D printed optimized double din dash kit looks and fits better than most aftermarket solutions. No fasteners are required due to the built-in clips, which securely lock in the head unit to the radio cage. Thoughtfully designed with a slight upwards tilt to reduce glare and improve screen colors. No supports required!

This dash kit is designed for the 7" ATOTO A6 PF (A6G2A7PF), but should also fit their other 7" head units which share the same body style (eg. F7 and S8 standard)

Spray paint with Quick Color J2853 Flat Black to color match with the interior and reduce the printed grain.
