# Toy Piano
3D printed toy piano for Project 1 of CECS447 Embedded Systems III at CSULB.
See attached report for details.

Bugs:
- Only includes one octave, so honestly it's sorta useless.
- Keys are pretty flimsy
- I didn't wire up the flats/sharps
- Didn't account for enough wires at the back
- Not required for Project 1
