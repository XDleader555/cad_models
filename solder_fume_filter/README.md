# Solder Fume Filter
Originally intended to filter dust from a room, this 120mm air filter will easily filter small amount of fumes from a short distance. It works great for soldering and whatnot.

At the max speed, the brushless fan can be quite loud. I have it controlled via an ATTiny85 and a IRL3803 MOSFET with a saftey flyback diode.
