# Corner Desk
Assembly plans for a home-made desk. Made specifically for a friend with tight space requirements.

Built out of wood, stain, and sealer purchased from Home Depot. Requires a Pocket Hole Jig which can be bought at a decent price from Harbor Freight.

See the [assembly pdf](https://github.com/XDleader555/cad_models/raw/main/corner_desk/res/Desk%20Assembly.pdf) in the res folder for printable plans.
