# cad_models
My collection of CAD models.
I model in Autodesk Inventor at home, but I primarily model in CATIA at work.

Please do not upload my models to other websites. They will be released to Printables and Thingiverse when they are ready.

Due to the [recent takedowns of user created 3D printed parts](https://hackaday.com/2022/04/21/the-honda-takedown-how-a-global-brand-failed-to-read-the-room/), I have refactored my repository just in case.
