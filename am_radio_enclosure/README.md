# AM Radio Enclosure
AM radio enclosure for a project I did for Physics 1C at El Camino.

The enclosure is made of laser cut acrylic, with a wooden bottom plate. The magnet wire inductor was hand wound around a 1.5in PVC pipe purchased from home depot. The top was lightly sanded to expose the copper for the tuner slide.

A basic LM386 amplifier circuit feeds the dollar bin speaker. A potentiometer on the front controls the volume.
