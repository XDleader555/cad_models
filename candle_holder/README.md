# Candle Holder
I saw these candle holders at the gift shop at Knott's Berry Farm back in 2016, and I had to make it as a gift for my parents.
I customized each side panel with a symbol for each of my family members. These edits have been removed for reasons, but I've left in the generic "ocean" and blank assemblies.

Laser cut the panels, glue together with wood glue, filet the edge with a belt sander, and seal with linseed oil.

Finally place a square candle glass in the center, which you can purchase from Dollar Tree or the 99c Store.
