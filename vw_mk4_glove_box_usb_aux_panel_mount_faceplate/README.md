# VW MK4 Glove Box USB AUX Panel Mount Faceplate
Hook this up to your aftermarket headunit on the off chance you need an AUX port, need to lock away a usb harddrive, securely charge your phone while you run errands, or tuck away an ipod.

There should be a factory blank at the back of the glovebox which you can knock out and press this panel mount into. The factory blank is for a cooling vent which doesn't usually come standard on most vehicles.

This faceplate only fits the following style universal panel mount product:
