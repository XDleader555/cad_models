# Hobby Knife Safety Cap
Yet another hobby knife safety cap. Unsatisfied with the available models online, I decided to create my own version. This model is a bit longer, uses tension in the design to keep the cap secure, and better fits the blades I'm using. This design is based off the x-acto blade safety cap which easily gets lost.

Optimized for 0.5mm nozzles. Print multiple at the same time to allow the part to cool.
