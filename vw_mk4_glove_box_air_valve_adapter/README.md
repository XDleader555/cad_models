# Glove Box Air Valve Adapter
If you want to retrofit the glove box air vent in your MK4 Volkswagen Golf/Jetta, the easiest and cheapest way is to pull the parts from a B5 Passat. The only issue is that the Passat HVAC box has mounting tabs which aren't present on the Golf/Jetta.

This 3D printable adapter replaces 3B1820701 to replicate 1J0816355 which came standard on Skoda variants. The connector is designed to interface with the Passat air hose.

Print both halves and glue together with plastic glue. Then glue the assembly to the back of the glove box valve.

Required parts:
3B1816311 - Air hose
3B0816355 - Glove box valve
