# Volkswagen MK4 Golf Grill Badge
I was having trouble finding this grill badge/emblem for my GTI, so I recreated it myself. Print the badge mount and stick a replacement hatch emblem to it. Knockoff hatch emblems can be found on Amazon, eBay, or Aliexpress for around $10. This model conveniently uses the same OEM mounting points.

Attach the optional slide lock and slide to towards the front after installation to prevent unwanted removal. Depress the center to release the lock.

If you can't procure a replacement hatch emblem for a reasonable price, you can print one of the included models and paint it to your liking.
