# Volkswagen MK4 Golf Grill Badge
I was having trouble finding this grill badge/emblem for my GTI, so I recreated it myself. Print the badge mount and stick a replacement hatch emblem to it. Knockoff hatch emblems can be found on Amazon, eBay, or Aliexpress for around $10. This model conveniently uses the same OEM mounting points.

Attach the optional slide lock and slide to towards the front after installation to prevent unwanted removal. Depress the center to release the lock.

If you can't procure a replacement hatch emblem for a reasonable price, you can print one of the included models, then sand and paint to your liking. The flat inset version can be printed with a layer change for a two tone effect. Vinyl decals also work well to fill the inset versions (You can find pre-cut vinyl at Badgeskins).
