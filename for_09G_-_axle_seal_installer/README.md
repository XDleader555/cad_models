# Axle seal install tool for Aisin 09G automatic transmissions
Tool for installing new axle seals into an 09G transmission.

Includes shims for varied install depths (and also because I didn't know what depth I needed at the time). Adapted for use with a [2in DWV pipe](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Charlotte-Pipe-2-in-x-2-ft-ABS-Foam-Core-Schedule-40-Drain-Waste-and-Vent-DWV-Pipe-ABS-03200-0200/202017937) when installing the passenger side seal.

Alternative to T10176 (left) and T10177 (right) OEM thrust piece installation tooling.
