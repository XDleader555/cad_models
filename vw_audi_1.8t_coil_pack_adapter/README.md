# Volkswagen/Audi 1.8T Coil Pack Adapter
These coil pack adapters let you use newer and cheaper R8/FSI/TSI ignition coil packs. I used 06E905115E which can be had for $18 per coil.

Probably not an upgrade you need right away, but a welcome one when your coils start to go. Even the Hitachi 06B905115E coils can go bad. (For me, one went out and then another shortly after)

On the older style valve cover with the factory bolt down coils, the newer coils will sit slightly off center. The pricey centered aluminum coil pack adapters can put stress on the components leading to premature failure. They also tend to not cover the entire coil well, allowing debris and moisture to fall into the spark plug hole. The OE 077905390 plastic adapter are no good either since they're centered as well. Without the adapters, engine vibrations can cause the coils to pop off the spark plug or fail due to stress.

These are modeled after the Hitachi 06B905115E coils, with predefined mounting angles from the OE 077905390 plastic adapter.

Print the coil pack adapters in ABS, upside down, with supports. If you wish to retain the vacuum reservoir or you're like me and can't be bothered to move it, print three of the reservoir retention standoffs. Press the compression limiters into the adapters and standoffs using a vise. Install the adapter on the coil first, and then push them onto the spark plug. Torque the bolts to spec. After installation, drive around until the engine is up to temperature and then re-torque the adapter bolts. 

You can purchase the ignition coil seal for improved moisture protection, but you can also print the included file in TPU.

Do not print in PETG or PLA. The valve cover sees around 190°F which is close to or past their glass transition temperature.
