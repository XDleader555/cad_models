# VW MK4 Golf 337 20th Aftermarket Shift Knob Adapter
Aftermarket replica 20th Anniversary/337 shift knobs come with plastic adapters which cause the shift knob to sit way too high. This adapter not only fixes the height, but it securely locks it in place.

Install the adapter through the top. Place the lock nut on the shifter rod first, then the new shift knob assembly. The new shift knob should click into place. Tighten the lock nut to prevent rotation of the shift knob and to lock it in place. Install the shift knob ball and then the sticker.
