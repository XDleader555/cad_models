# GTI Grill Badge Mount
I was having trouble finding this grill badge online for my VW MK4 GTI, so I recreated it myself. Print the badge mount and apply a replacement trunk badge to it, which can be found on Amazon or eBay for around $8.

Alternatively, if you can't order the replacement trunk badge, you can one of the included badges.

This project can also be found on thingiverse:

The original VW Part number is 1J6 853 679 C FDY.
