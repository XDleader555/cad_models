# Volkswagen MK4 Golf Grill Badge
I was having trouble finding this grill badge for my GTI, so I recreated it myself. Print the badge mount and apply a replacement trunk badge to it, which can be found on Amazon or eBay for around $10. This model conveniently uses the same OEM mounting points.

Attach the slide lock before installing, and slide it towards the front to prevent unwanted removal. 

If you can't order the replacement trunk badge, you can print one of the included badge models and paint to your liking.

TDI badge mount is approximate since I don't own a TDI. Send me a PM if you have the dimensions for this badge.

You can also remix the template file to create a custom badge mount.

Volkswagen badge/emblem part numbers:
1J6853679CFDY GTI Chrome 25th
1J6853679HJGS GTI Chrome/Red
1J6853679DPWV R32 Chrome
1J6853679EGQF V6 Chrome/Red

There's no official part number for the TDI grill badge.
