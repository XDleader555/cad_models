# Volkswagen MKIV/A4/B5 Sunroof Drain Tube Insert
The rear sunroof drain tubes appear to have shrunk and pulled away from the ball end fitting, which allows drain water to leak directly onto my headliner.

Pry the hose from the ball end fitting using a flat head screwdriver and a twisting motion to break away the glue. (Apparently it's only glued in two places instead of all the way around)

Heat up the end of the tube with a heat gun to around 100 °C (212 °Freedom) or dip it in boiling water to soften it up, then push the insert in until it bottoms out.

Clean the mating surfaces of the ball end fitting and the drain tube, then re-assemble using RTV or epoxy.

Apply a light coating of RTV to the inside of the ball end fitting before re-installation.

Finally, enjoy searching for the other water leaks you missed. (RTV the front drain tubes, cut the nipples off the drain hose grommets, clear any clogged drains, caulk the rear air vents behind the rear bumper cover, etc.)
