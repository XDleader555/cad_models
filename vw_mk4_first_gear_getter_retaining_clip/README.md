# VW MK4 Golf Jetta First Gear Getter Shifter Retaining Clip
Retaining clip for DieselGeek's amazing first gear getter bushing. Under heavy use, the bushing tends to fall out due to a friction fit.

The official fix is to degrease and add RTV to the outer diameter of the bushing, which doesn't seem very secure to me. This 3D printed plastic clip slides over the bushing and holds everything securely in place.
